# Crime Classification: End-to-End Documentation

Welcome to the Crime Classification System, a project developed as a submission to the Rihal Codestacker 2025 Machine Learning Challenge. This repository documents a full-stack machine learning pipeline—from raw data to real-time predictions—centered on the compelling task of predicting crime categories from a variety of inputs including police reports, timestamps, and GPS coordinates.

But this is more than just a classification model. It's a cohesive system engineered to address a real-world problem: how can we understand, contextualize, and predict crime using machine learning, spatial analytics, and natural language processing?

This documentation is your guide through the entire journey. Along the way, you'll see how exploratory data analysis, NLP, spatial reasoning, temporal pattern mining, and MLOps converge into a modern, reproducible ML system—culminating in an interactive dashboard that puts all of this power into the hands of users.

## 1. Introduction & Motivation

**Project Overview**  
This project aims to classify crime occurrences in San Francisco (or "CityX") based on:

- **Textual Descriptions** (Descript or PDF-based text)
- **Spatial Information** (longitude, latitude, police district)
- **Temporal Aspects** (date, time-of-day, day-of-week patterns)

By effectively **engineering these features**, I built a robust classification model that distinguishes between multiple crime categories. Finally, I made an **interactive dashboard** that allows both data exploration and real-time predictions, including advanced functionalities like **PDF parsing** of crime reports and **integration with Google's Gemini** for text rephrasing.

**Objectives**:

1. **Explore and visualize** the crime dataset to uncover relevant patterns.
2. **Engineer features** (NLP, spatial, temporal) to enhance classification performance.
3. **Train and evaluate** a multi-class CatBoost model.
4. **Track experiments** with MLflow for reproducibility and transparency.
5. **Deploy a Streamlit dashboard** to demonstrate real-time crime prediction and data insights.

---

## 2. Data Exploration

I begin by loading the **Competition_Dataset.csv** into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("Competition_Dataset.csv")
```

**Initial Checks**:

- **Shape**: data.shape to see the number of rows and columns.
- **Columns**: data.columns to list available features.
- **Quick Inspect**: data.head() and data.info() to observe data types, non-null counts, etc.
- **Missing Values**: Identify columns that might contain NaNs and assess if/where imputation is needed.

Example output might confirm columns such as:

```json
[
    "Dates",
    "Category",
    "Descript",
    "DayOfWeek",
    "PdDistrict",
    "Resolution",
    "Longitude (X)",
    "Latitude (Y)"
]
```

---

## 3. Data Visualization & Observation

I visualized the data to gain crucial insights:

1. **Category Distribution**  
   - A bar chart of Category frequencies to see which crimes are most common.
2. **Temporal Patterns**  
   - Charts of crime counts by day-of-week, hour-of-day, or month to spot periodic trends.
3. **Geospatial Plots**  
   - Scatter maps or heatmaps to see how crimes cluster in specific neighborhoods or near city landmarks.

**Takeaways**:

- Certain categories dominate the dataset, like **LARCENY/THEFT**.
- Crime rates vary by time of day, pointing to strong diurnal patterns.
- Spatial clustering around major districts suggests location-based features could be valuable.

---

## 4. Feature Engineering

### 4.1 Text Preprocessing (NLP)

Since crime descriptions in Descript provide valuable context, I applied a standard NLP pipeline:

1. **Text Cleaning**  
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, removing extra spaces, etc.

    ```python
       def preprocess_text(text):
           text = text.lower()
           text = re.sub(f"[{string.punctuation}]", " ", text)
           text = re.sub(r"\d+", "", text)
           text = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text).strip()
           return text
    ```

2. **TF-IDF Transformation**  
   - Convert the processed text into numerical vectors.
   - Use TfidfVectorizer with max_features=200, unigrams & bigrams, and English stop words removed.

    ```python
       tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=200, stop_words="english", ngram_range=(1, 2))
       tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(df["Descript_processed"])
    ```

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Apply TruncatedSVD(n_components=50) to capture the main latent topics without exploding feature space.

4. **Appending NLP Features**  
   - The resulting 50 SVD components become new columns: tfidf_Descript_0 … tfidf_Descript_49.
   - Top terms per component are logged for interpretability.

### 4.2 Spatial Features

Crime incidence often depends on **location**. I engineered:

1. **Grid Cell Assignment**  
   - Divided SF into a 5×5 grid (25 cells).  
   - Each record gets a GridCell ID (0–24) based on (Longitude, Latitude).

2. **Crime Density**  
   - For each GridCell, computed total crimes and normalized by the maximum count, storing in CrimeDensity.
   - Category-specific density columns, e.g. Density_THEFT, highlight how concentrated each crime type is in each grid cell.

3. **Time-Space Interactions**  
   - For each (district, time_period) or (grid_cell, time_period), I computed a **risk score** (how frequently crimes occur in that spatio-temporal slice).
   - **TimeLocationRisk, GridTimeRisk, WeekendLocationRisk, GridWeekendRisk** columns capture these interactions.

4. **Distance from City Center**  
   - Euclidean distance to a reference point (-122.4194, 37.7749), stored as DistanceFromCenter.

### 4.3 Temporal Features

1. **Extract Hour, Day, Month, DayOfWeek** from Dates.
2. **Weekend Flag** to distinguish weekends vs. weekdays.
3. **TimePeriod** (0=Morning, 1=Afternoon, 2=Evening, 3=Night) to capture daily crime cycles.

### 4.4 Combining Features

A master function (e.g., process_data()) was created to:

- Run textual cleaning + TF-IDF + SVD (with already-fitted models).
- Construct or look up advanced spatial features if X/Y columns exist.
- Build a final numeric feature set used by the model.

## 5. Model Training & Evaluation

### 5.1 Training Pipeline Overview

The **training script** train.py demonstrates the pipeline:

1. **Load & Split Data**  

    ```python
       train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, stratify=data["Category"])
    ```

2. **NLP Feature Extraction**  

    ```python
       train_nlp, tfidf_vectorizer, svd_transformer, feature_names = \
           extract_nlp_features(train, "Descript", max_features=200, n_components=50)
    ```

3. **Feature Processing**  

    ```python
       X_full = process_data(train_nlp, tfidf_vectorizer, svd_transformer)
       y_full = train_nlp["Category"]
       X_test = process_data(test, tfidf_vectorizer, svd_transformer)
    ```

4. **Second Split** (Train/Val):

    ```python
       X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_full, y_full, test_size=0.2, stratify=y_full)
    ```

5. **Define CatBoost & Fit**  

    ```python
   model_params = {
      "iterations": 1000, "learning_rate": 0.05, "depth": 8,
      "l2_leaf_reg": 3,
      "loss_function": "MultiClass",
      "eval_metric": "TotalF1",
   }
   model = CatBoostClassifier(**model_params, task_type="GPU")
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=(X_val, y_val), use_best_model=True)
   ```

6. **Evaluate** using F1 (macro, weighted) and Accuracy.

### 5.2 Performance Evaluation

- **Accuracy**  

    ```python
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, val_predictions)
    ```

- **Macro F1**  

    ```python
   macro_f1 = f1_score(y_val, val_predictions, average="macro")
    ```

- **Weighted F1**  

    ```python
   weighted_f1 = f1_score(y_val, val_predictions, average="weighted")
    ```

    Metrics are logged to MLflow for easy comparison across experiment runs.

### 5.3 Feature Importance Analysis

Using CatBoost's **get_feature_importance()**:

```python
importance = model.get_feature_importance()
```

I plotted a bar chart where **NLP features** are highlighted in a different color. This reveals how textual info compares to spatial-temporal features in importance. Some top contributors often include time-of-day risk features, district-based risk, and certain TF-IDF components related to "theft," "vehicle," or "assault."

---

## 6. MLflow Integration & Experiment Tracking

### 6.1 Logging Artifacts

I leveraged MLflow for:

- **Parameters & Metrics**:

    ```python
    mlflow.log_params(model_params)
    mlflow.log_metrics({"accuracy": accuracy, "macro_f1": macro_f1, ...})
    ```

- **Plots**: Feature importance plot saved and logged as an artifact.
- **Model Checkpoint**:

    ```python
   mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model", registered_model_name="crime_classification_model")
    ```

- **Preprocessing Objects**:  
  - TF-IDF vectorizer & SVD transformer pickled and logged.
- **Datasets**: Snapshots of train/test CSVs for reproducibility.

### 6.2 Metadata & Environment Tracking

- **JSON Metadata** capturing feature names, date of training, model run ID, etc.
- **Environment Files**: requirements.txt or pip freeze logs for environment reproducibility.

## 7. Interactive Streamlit Application

### 7.1 Overview of the Streamlit App

I built a **Streamlit** dashboard (app.py) to combine:

- Real-time **crime category predictions**.
- **Geospatial** and **temporal** interactive visualizations.
- PDF ingestion that **extracts key fields** from police reports.
- Optional **Google Gemini** integration to rephrase descriptions into standardized formats before prediction.

Users can navigate among four main sections:

1. **Map Visualization**
2. **Crime Prediction**
3. **Crime Statistics**
4. **PDF Upload**

### 7.2 Key Features & User Flow

1. **Map Visualization**  
   - Filters by date range, crime categories, and police districts.
   - Option to display points (ScatterPlotLayer) and a heatmap (HeatmapLayer) on a deck.gl map.
   - A legend to clarify color codes for different crime categories.
   - A date/time range filter for **temporal** exploration.

2. **Crime Prediction**  
   - Users enter a *crime description*, date/time, district, and coordinates.
   - The app processes these inputs (including advanced spatial features and text transformations) and returns:
     - **Predicted Crime Category**  
     - **Confidence** & top 5 probabilities  
     - A brief explanation of influential features (spatial/temporal/text).
     - A mini map showing the user's provided location.

3. **Crime Statistics**  
   - **Time-series** visualizations (line charts) aggregated by day, week, month, or year.
   - **Bar plots** showing distribution by Category and District.
   - Ability to refine the dataset using the same filters from the sidebar.

4. **PDF Upload**  
   - Allows uploading **PDF** crime reports (ex: official police documents).
   - Extracts labeled fields (Report Number, Date & Time, Reporting Officer, etc.) via pdfplumber and regex patterns.
   - Pre-fills a form with the extracted fields so the user can review/edit them, then run the crime prediction.

### 7.3 Integration with Model & Gemini API

1. **Model Artifacts Loading**  

    ```python
       model, tfidf, svd, metadata = get_model_artifacts()
    ```

   - Locates the "latest" model artifacts directory, loads the CatBoost model (.cbm), TF-IDF, SVD, and metadata.

2. **Prediction Functions**  
   - **make_prediction()**: The standard route that processes text, adds engineered features, and generates a prediction.
   - **make_prediction_with_gemini()**: If "Use Gemini" is enabled, the text is first **rephrased** into a standardized format using Google's Gemini. Then it is fed into the same feature pipeline.

3. **Google Gemini**  
   - Called via rephrase_description_with_gemini().
   - Takes the user's raw description and prompts the Gemini API to convert it to a recognized "standardized" police format.
   - If the response does not exactly match a known format, fallback or retry logic is triggered.

### 7.4 PDF Upload & Crime Report Extraction

- Users upload a PDF.  
- **pdfplumber** extracts text from each page, concatenated into one string.  
- A set of **regex patterns** captures labeled fields, e.g.:
  - **Report Number:** Report Number:\s*(.*?)\s*Date & Time:
  - **Coordinates:** Coordinates:\s*(\([^)]*\))\s*Detailed Description:
- The relevant fields are displayed and can be edited before making a final prediction. Coordinates are parsed and (if needed) adjusted for the final location-based features.

## 8. Conclusion & Future Work

**Summary**  

- I explored the dataset, noting key spatial-temporal trends.
- I engineered advanced features—**NLP** (TF-IDF + SVD), **grid-based crime density**, **time-of-day risk**, etc.
- I trained a **CatBoost** classifier, logging everything with **MLflow**.
- The final **Streamlit** app provides real-time prediction, interactive mapping, PDF parsing, and an optional **Gemini** integration for text rephrasing into standardized crime formats.

**Lessons Learned**  

- Combining textual data with well-thought-out spatial and temporal features significantly boosts crime classification performance.
- Logging preprocessing objects (TF-IDF, SVD, feature mappings) is crucial for reproducibility.
- The advanced PDF ingestion highlights the potential to automate real-world police reporting workflows.

**Next Steps**  

1. **Further Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning or using advanced search methods (Optuna, Hyperopt) for CatBoost.  
2. **Extended Geospatial Modeling**: Possibly integrating more robust geospatial libraries or using clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) for more nuanced location patterns.  
3. **Deployment**: Dockerizing the Streamlit app or providing an AWS/GCP-based hosting solution.  
4. **Additional Data**: Incorporating external datasets, such as weather or demographic data, to uncover deeper crime correlations.
